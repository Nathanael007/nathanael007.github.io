## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the 8bit-cpu project! This software allows you to build and explore an 8-bit CPU in Logisim. It includes a custom instruction set, ALU, registers, control unit, and memory interface. 

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following:
1. **Logisim**: Download the latest version of Logisim from [Logisim's official website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). This software is essential to run the 8-bit CPU project.
2. **Operating System**: The 8bit-cpu project is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

### 📂 Download & Install
Visit this page to download the software: [Releases Page](https://github.com/Nathanael007/8bit-cpu/releases).

1. Open the link above.
2. You will see a list of available releases. Choose the most recent version by selecting the topmost entry.
3. Click on the asset file suitable for your operating system (e.g., a `.zip` or `.jar` file).
4. The file will download to your computer. Locate the file in your downloads folder.

### 🔧 Opening the Project
1. If you downloaded a `.zip` file, extract it to a folder of your choice.
2. Navigate to the folder and look for a file named `8bit-cpu.circ` or similar.
3. Open Logisim.
4. In Logisim, click on **File** and select **Open**.
5. Browse to the location where you extracted the files and select the `8bit-cpu.circ` file.

### 📊 Exploring the Features
After opening the project, you can explore various features:
- **Custom Instruction Set**: This allows you to write simple assembly programs.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Use the ALU to perform operations like addition and subtraction.
- **Registers**: Stores data that the CPU can quickly access.
- **Control Unit**: Manages the execution of instructions.
- **Memory Interface**: Connects to memory storage for program and data.

### 📋 Basic Usage
1. **Run the CPU**: After opening the circuit in Logisim, you can simulate the CPU. Click the **Simulate** tab, then click **Run**.
2. **Load Programs**: You can write and load simple assembly programs to see how the CPU executes them.
3. **Debugging**: Use Logisim’s tools to step through your programs and examine the values of registers and memory.

### 📈 Examples
Here are some examples of assembly programs you can try:
- **Hello World**: Displays the message "Hello World" using the CPU.
- **Simple Calculator**: Adds two numbers and outputs the result.
- **Count to Ten**: Increments a number from 1 to 10 and displays each value.

### 📖 Documentation
The `README.md` contains information on how to use the CPU, including its instruction set and sample programs. For more detailed instruction, you can refer to the comments within the Logisim project files.

### 🛡️ Support
If you encounter issues or have questions, you can open an issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Nathanael007/8bit-cpu/issues). Alternatively, feel free to join discussions in the GitHub repository.
